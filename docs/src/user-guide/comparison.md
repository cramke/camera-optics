# System Comparison

Compare multiple camera configurations side-by-side.

## Adding Systems

1. Enter camera specifications in the input form
2. Click "Calculate FOV" to verify the configuration
3. Click "Add System" to save it for comparison

The system will appear in the comparison list with:
- System name (or auto-generated name like "System 1")
- Color indicator for visualization
- Edit and delete buttons

## Comparing Systems

### Visualization Overlay

When multiple systems are added, they appear overlaid on the canvas:
- Each system has a unique color
- FOV rectangles show relative sizes
- Dimensions are labeled

### Numerical Comparison

The comparison list shows:
- FOV dimensions (mm)
- Spatial resolution (PPM)
- Coverage area

## Editing Systems

Click the edit button (✎) on any system to:
1. Load its values into the input form
2. Modify the values
3. Click the save button (✔) to update

Changes are reflected immediately in the visualization.

## Use Cases

### Sensor Format Comparison

Compare crop factor impact:
- Full frame (36×24mm) with 50mm lens
- APS-C (23.5×15.6mm) with 35mm lens (equivalent FOV)
- Micro Four Thirds (17.3×13mm) with 25mm lens

### Lens Selection

Find the right focal length:
- Add systems with different focal lengths
- Keep sensor and distance constant
- Compare coverage at your working distance

### Resolution Analysis

Evaluate spatial resolution:
- Compare different sensor resolutions
- Same physical size, different pixel counts
- See impact on PPM and GSD
