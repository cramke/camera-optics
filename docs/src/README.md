# Introduction

Welcome to the Camera Optics Calculator documentation!

This application helps you calculate and visualize camera system performance, including field of view (FOV), spatial resolution, and depth of field calculations.

## What You Can Do

- **Calculate Field of View**: Determine the angular and linear FOV for any camera/lens combination
- **Spatial Resolution**: Calculate pixels per millimeter (PPM) and ground sample distance (GSD)
- **Depth of Field**: Calculate near/far limits and total DOF for given aperture settings
- **Compare Systems**: Overlay and compare multiple camera configurations
- **CLI or GUI**: Use the tool via command-line or graphical interface

## Built With

- **Rust** - Fast, safe backend calculations via Tauri
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe frontend UI
- **Vite** - Modern build tooling
- **Canvas API** - Real-time visualization
